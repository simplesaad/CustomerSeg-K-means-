## Introduction

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered the one of the simplest model among them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data**. In this notebook, you learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:
- Customer segmentation
- Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
- Pattern recognition
- Machine learning
- Data compression


In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with examples:
- Using k-means for customer segmentation

K-means will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups, for example, into 3 clusters. The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically.
Now we can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of each cluster. 
For example, the 3 clusters can be:

- AFFLUENT, EDUCATED AND OLD AGED
- MIDDLE AGED AND MIDDLE INCOME
- YOUNG AND LOW INCOME
